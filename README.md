# CS-1030-Website

## This is a website I built for my College CS 1030 Class where we were required to build a website based on our research for different topics within Computer Science, prior to this class I acquired a certification in Interactive Website Development and was able to use my skills to go above and beyond the requirments for the assignemnts. However, I was unable to finish the project inside class but I am planning on going back and finishing this website. 

- I wanted to go above and beyond in my CS 1030 Class and make this a web development project I could show off. 
- I built this with the intent of growing and building upon this website outside of my CS 1030 Class and use it to refine my web development skills.
- The website itself doesn't necessarily solve a problem besides it's a good way for me to practice my HTML/CSS skills, also if anyone needs information on one of the topics listed inside the website they will be able to go to each section and read about the topic along with sources that go more in depth on the topic.
- I learned that I am capable of being creative with the design of my websites, not just stick with one static design pattern.
