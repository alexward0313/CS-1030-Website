        <p>
            Machine Learning Engineers are the one's who build Artificial Intelligence models, the reason why it's called Machine<br>
            Learning and not Artificial Intelligence is because more accurately the Engineers develop programs that can recognize<br>
            patterns in a set of data. In order to become a Machine Learning Engineer you need to be proficient in math and data<br>
            handling skills, along with the ability to use TensorFlow, Python, C++, and R. This career is in high demand and the<br>
            average salary is $140,000.

    <div class = paragraph-container-div>
        <p>
            Full Stack Developers are Software Developers who work in both the Backend and Frontend of an application, meaning<br>
            they work on all aspects of the application being developed. To become a Full Stack Developer one needs to be<br>
            proficient in programming languages that are for both the Backend and Frontend, for example a Full Stack Developer<br>
            would use: Java, SQL, Ruby, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C++, MongoDB, Python, BrainF***, etc. Full Stack Developers are<br>

        <h2 class = career-h2>Indie Game Developer</h2>
    </div>

    <div class = paragraph-container-div>
        <p>
            Indie Game Developer is by far the most difficult and riskiest career path on this list, when I say Indie Game<br>
            Developer I'm talking about someone who makes an Indie Game all by themselves or with a small group of people.<br>
            This means that they are in charge of everything that goes into developing a good game such as level layout, <br>
            player character controls, interactive elements, gameplay, music, sound, non-player characters, cut-scenes, <br>
            story, etc. The initial investment is insane, but the return can be incredible. The average Indie Game Developer<br>
            makes $80,000 a year, but a successful one can earn up to $1,000,000 a year. More realistically a good game <br>
            would bring in about $250,000.
