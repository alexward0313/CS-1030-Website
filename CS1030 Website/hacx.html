          <span class = "glitchtext">Trojan</span> malware, also known as <span class = "glitchtext">Trojan Horse</span>, is a type of malicious software that <br>
          disguises itself as a legitimate program in order to trick users into installing it on <br>
          their computer systems. Once the Trojan is installed, it can execute a variety of harmful <br>
          actions, such as stealing personal information, downloading additional malware, or <br>
          providing unauthorized access to the infected computer.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "paragraph-container-div2">
        <p>
          One of the major challenges of <span class = "glitchtext">Trojan</span> malware is its ability to evade traditional <br>
          security defenses. For example, it can be spread through phishing scams, infected email <br>
          attachments, and malicious websites. To avoid falling victim to a Trojan attack, it is <br>
          important to be cautious when downloading and installing new software, being wary of <br>
          suspicious emails and links, and keeping your computer’s operating system and <br>
          installed programs up-to-date.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class = "paragraph-container-div2">
        <p>
          In the event that a <span class = "glitchtext">Trojan</span> is discovered on a computer system, it is important to <br>
          take immediate action to remove it. This can typically be achieved by running a <br>
          full scan with a reputable antivirus program and deleting any detected malware. <br>
          However, in some cases, the infected files may be deeply embedded and difficult to <br>
          remove. In such situations, it may be necessary to completely reformat the hard <br>
          drive and reinstall the operating system to fully eradicate the malware. It is <br>
          also important to change any compromised passwords and monitor financial accounts <br>
          for any suspicious activity.
