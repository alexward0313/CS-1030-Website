        <p>The first ever programmer, Ada Lovelace, was born in London on December 10th 1815. Her parents <br>seperated 
            when she was young and she never personally knew her father, in her younger years she was tutored <br>privately.  
            Eventually she began to self-teach with the help of a reknown mathematician-logician, Augustus De <br>Morgan, 
            her studies and curiosity would lead her to becoming interested in Babbage's machines and to becoming <br>the first 
            ever programmer.
        </p>
    
        <p>It was in 1833 when Ada Lovelace stumbled upon Babbage's machine, she was fascinated by it and ended up <br>translating 
            a French Article by Luigi Menabrea explaining the Analytical Engine. With this translation Ada added her <br>own notes 
            to the article which includes a sequence of operations for solving certain mathematical problems, these <br>operations 
            were the first published "lines of code" that would be used to help advance the Analytical Machine. Another <br>thing 
            Ada included in the article is the prediction that eventually we won't be programming with numbers and with <br>words 
            that have a numerical value to the machine. Biographers debate the importance of Ada's contribution but one <br>thing 
            is for certain, that she is the first ever programmer who paved the way for modern programming. <br>
        </p>
    
        <p>Today, modern programming would not be what it is without Ada Lovelace's contribution to Babbage's Analytical <br>Machine.  
        The syntax or even the programming languages themselves could be entirely different if it weren't for her <br>developing the  
        first instance of the structure of programming. Even if what she did had a minor impact on how we program <br>today, her 
        contribution is still noteworthy in discussing the history of how computers and modern technology came to <br>fruition.
