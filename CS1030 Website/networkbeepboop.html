            Networking is important for everything in our society, to connect with friends, collegues, family, <br>
            and networking is most vital for businesses to connect with their teams and clients. Without the <br>
            hardware necessary for networking a business is a lot more prone to failure when their competitors <br>
            most likely have the upper hand in spreading their influence with tools tailored towards networking <br>
            in their space of expertise.

        <p>
            The fictional scenerio that I have chosen to analyze is a small tech startup business with five employees. <br>
            The company was just formed and the team needs to budget for hardware and devices used for networking in <br>
            order to work together on their product and to reach out to make connections with the potential clients <br>
            and investors.

            <li><b>Router</b>: $100-$300</li>
            <li><b>Switch</b>: $100-$200</li>

        <p>
            Based on the amount of five employees and depending on the specific models purchased, the total cost of all the hardware <br>
            will come to about $4000 to $8000. This is a rough estimate and not an exact total, again it depends on how much money the <br>
            startup is willing to invest in this equipment.
